================

A kind of pedagogic material to play around colaborative archives.

The idea here is to build some kind of social network focused on generate over the people and the interactions a colaborative archive, based on such a magic autopoietic-BBDD as [Magick mem set](https://github.com/aleph1888/magicmemset), by Bum2 (hope one day he hears about this project!).

We are planning to start!

January 2016!
