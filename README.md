ataraxia_archive
================

A kind of ***pedagogic material*** to play around collaborative archives.

The idea here is to build some **kind of social network** focused on generate over the people and the interactions a **collaborative archive**, based on such a magic autopoietic-BBDD as [Magick mem set](https://github.com/aleph1888/magicmemset), by @bum2 (hope one day he hears about this project!).

We are planning to start!

April 2016!

See landing page for [Ataraxia Archive](http://aleph1888.github.io/ataraxia_archive).

About project
---------------

The goal is here to play with Web Semantic to highlevel code running *record* and *record_types* in MMS. So data models are being generated dinamically on run time, just for [basic types](https://github.com/aleph1888/magicmemset/blob/master/General_20140723.sql) set will.

----------------
Ok, so retake 2016 landing is done. See description for full details.

Just take a look to [gh-pages](https://github.com/aleph1888/ataraxia_archive/tree/gh-pages) branch.

Then take a look to [master](https://github.com/aleph1888/ataraxia_archive/tree/master) branch where you will find packages just to be listed, empty folders. Check then for their branches to find code.
